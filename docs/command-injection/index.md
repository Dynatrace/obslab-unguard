# Command Injection

--8<-- "snippets/bizevent-command-injection.js"

Unguard has a command injection vulnerability in the image posting feature of the `proxy-service`.

Let's attempt that now.

## Exploitation

Posting the following will result in executing `whoami` after `example.com` has been fetched.

To exploit the command injection vulnerability in the `proxy-service`:

* Log in to Unguard
* Post an image with an URL that adds a second command to the `curl` call.

```
example.com && whoami #
```

!!! info "Remove original curl arguments"
    Notice the trailing `#` will comment out all the other original curl arguments, which is essential.


## Result: SQL Injection Blocked

!!! success
    Dynatrace OneAgent has successfully blocked the SQL injection attack!

To verify that it really has been blocked:

* Click `Home`
* Go back to your profile
* You should still see the empty box and `Add bio` text
