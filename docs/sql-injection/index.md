# SQL Injection

--8<-- "snippets/bizevent-sql-injection.js"

Unguard has an SQL injection vulnerability in the `profile-service`. You can exploit this via the `User profile` setting.

Let's attempt that now.

# Exploitation

To inject an SQL command, you simply need to log into Unguard, go to your profile page and insert a bio using the following text. This will set the text of all users (where their bio is currently unset) to `injected`:

![unguard profile drilldown](../images/unguard-profile-drilldown.png)

!!! info "If the button says `Add Bio`"

    ```
    '); UPDATE bio SET bio_text = 'injected' WHERE 1 = 1; --
    ```

!!! info "If the button says `Update Bio`"

    ```
    ' WHERE 0 = 1; UPDATE bio SET bio_text = 'injected' WHERE 1 = 1; --
    ```
    In this case, the beginning has to be slightly different to accommodate the syntax of the ```INSERT INTO``` statement.

## Result: SQL Injection Blocked

!!! success
    Dynatrace OneAgent has successfully blocked the SQL injection attack!

To verify that it really has been blocked:

* Click `Home`
* Go back to your profile
* You should still see the empty box and `Add bio` text
